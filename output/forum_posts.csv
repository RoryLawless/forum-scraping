		 Sure, depending on what information you were looking for. If you were just looking at elementaries and wondering about upper grades, this first page is a quicker glance at what the numbers are. Yes, schools can always add additional kids in upper grades but just poking around the Cap Hill schools, it is apparent that some of them have fifth grade classes that are half the size of the rest of the grades, and decreases in other upper grades too.",17

		 Something similar is true at our school and I found out many Asian families at our school reported as mixed race for a variety of non-obvious reasons. Does your school report a substantial mixed race population? That group is overwhelmingly partially Asian at our school, which surprised me. Many students who I would have identified as mixed race self-identified as Black and many students I would have identified as Asian identified as mixed. Obviously their self-identification is the one that matters. I’d just say that, from personal experience, you may be mistaken.",18

		 That is part of the reason why the sixth grade class at EH is so big this year. The school had a certain projection (based on past data) and let in a specific number of OOB students based on that projection. They need to accept all IB students, and more IB students came this year from the feeder schools so they ended up over enrolled by 20-30 students and needing to hire a new teacher. Managing enrollment at any school must be difficult but middle and high school DCPS by right schools have it the hardest IMO because they can't cap enrollment.",27

		 Yes, in the absence of at risk/non-at risk measures... S-H and E-H gained similar numbers of white students (19 v 20), which we can pretty much guarantee are UMC, and S-H gained 13 IB students... so it's hard for me to see this as a bad news story for S-H as your comment originally painted it. It is true that E-H and Jefferson both gained substantial amounts of IB students, which is fantastic.

"Anonymous wrote:I have heard that child age cohorts are fluctuating, I think birth rate went down and continue going down. Is that reflected somewhere in these data sets?
		 Haven't searched through the data set for it but I know there was a ""baby boom"" on Capitol Hill in 2016-2017 and you can track it through lottery data with waitlists and class sizes at CH schools. I heard about it at daycares in the area at the time and knew people who had kids those years who struggled for childcare more than is typical and then noticed the bump in the lottery as well. I think it's dissipating at this point because those kids are now entering middle elementary and there's enough churn on the Hill that I don't think it impacts enrollment or waitlists like it used to. But even with the disruption of Covid you could track it through the PK and K years.",30

Biggest drops in K and 4th. I'm sure there's plenty more to say. Enjoy!
		 Flat enrollment doesn't tell the TR story. Problem with bolded is that much of what TR sells is its culture. When the 5th grade and MS classes are mostly new kids, the culture they so heavily market doesn't exist. Note the increase at Young in PK for last year against historic levels (+20%) when overall enrollment was flat. That means they are trying to refill the pipeline from all the attrition in upper grades. White population at Young goes from 26% in K-5 to 13% in MS. Flat enrollment pays bills in near term while masking systemic problems.",36

		 Yes, in the absence of at risk/non-at risk measures... S-H and E-H gained similar numbers of white students (19 v 20), which we can pretty much guarantee are UMC, and S-H gained 13 IB students... so it's hard for me to see this as a bad news story for S-H as your comment originally painted it. It is true that E-H and Jefferson both gained substantial amounts of IB students, which is fantastic. (Jefferson actually lost white students though, from 18 to 13.)

		 I think there are tons of variables at play here. Births have slowed down - families who may have traditionally left DC have not (For a variety of reasons: enjoying being in DC, high interest rates, feeling more comfortable with DC school options etc).  At least part of the population shift may be from people moving to DC - https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/population-in-three-charts-2023/ has some info/numbers "" In 2023, net domestic outmigration was down to 1,509 (0.2 percent of the previous year’s population). Despite this loss of people to other states, the total net migration to D.C. was positive, at 5,460, (0.8 percent of the previous year’s population) thanks to 6,969 net new residents who moved to D.C. from outside the United States."" Very anecdotal, but I have seen an increase in Hispanic students at our Cap Hill ES, and I know they hired an additional ESL teacher at Eastern last year.",44

		 I was on the DME Boundary Advisory Committee, and one of the things we talked about was the housing pipeline and how that would impact school enrollment. Edscape's data is a bit outdated (https://edscape.dc.gov/page/neighborhood-factors-residential-development-pipeline-ward) but we viewed and discussed more current data - and the Georgia Ave and nearby corridor has had a ton of development recently (https://dc.urbanturf.com/articles/blog/the-10-projects-in-the-works-along-the-takoma-georgia-avenue-pipeline/20860) Also part of the discussion (which I think was mentioned in the Two Rivers thread) is how many OOB spots these schools offer.  Per this site the thread is about, https://edscape.dc.gov/node/1730326  now 60% of the 1000+ seats at Coolidge are from students who live out of boundary. Now they could have enrolled in a feeder and had feeder rights, so it is not exactly accurate that they open up 60% of their seats to OOB kids each year in the lottery. How many OOB seats should be allotted in MS and HS lotteries was discussed in that committee.",51

Guessing you are an AAPI family concerned about representation in DC schools and that AAPI kids tend to be marginalized in DC schools. All of which is fair. Your anger is misplaced. If AAPI enrollment is underreported it isn't because DC seeks to underrepresent AAPI kids and it isn't because DCUM dismisses AAPI kids. It is because those kids are not being enrolled as AAPI. Your issue is with the AAPI community and not DC schools or DCUM.   
		 You're reading anger where there is none. I repeatedly said that the people excited to get race-based data should take it with a grain of salt because it's self-evidently not correct in at least one obvious regard.  Then a bunch of people pushed back, often repeating what I had already said (it might be self reporting!  You joined this trend of ignoring that I have already said that, in my very first post, but you are not alone) or ignoring the post they were responding to (maybe they're mixed? in response to a post about how I know enough of the families to know that there are more non-mixed Asian kids in the school than one).  My surprise that people are so determined to shout down the discussion is not anger, and no I do not have any issue with the AAPI community in DC.  All I was doing was trying to provide a note of caution about all the people chiming in excited to extrapolate from inacurrate racial data.  
		 You deny being angry but then you throw around words and phrases like ""not correct"" and ""inaccurate"". Why do you think you are more qualified to determine how these kids identify than the parents filling out the paperwork? I don't see how you can use such language and also claim to have n problem with the AAPI community. If you think the data is ""wrong"" then the logical conclusion is that the AAPI community has failed you. Also, where are you reading that anyone is trying to ""shut down discussion""? People disagree on DCUM all the time. I didn't see anyone attack you or call you names; they disagreed with you. That's how this works.  
		 I think the PP is just being pedantic. Of course these numbers will not be 100% to-the-letter accurate at all times -- there will always be inaccuracies or inconsistencies in voluntary data collection and self-identification. For the AAPI population in DCPS this can mean the numbers are wrong by large percentages -- if there are 8 AAPI kids in a school and the data only identifies 4 (whether due to choices in self-identification or errors in data entry) then you have 50% discrepancy. But this is only because the numbers  for AAPI are so small and are exacerbated by issues in self-identification among AAPI families who are mixed race or who may have concerns about self-identifying as AAPI. The problem is the PP then extrapolates this to mean none of the race data is accurate and cannot be trusted or used to draw conclusions. This is not a reasonable conclusion. First even with the inaccuracies in the AAPI data you can draw broad conclusions -- AAPI numbers in most DCPS schools are quite small (smaller than the population of AAPI in DC) and do not appear to be growing. That's a useful observation that is unaffected by a school reportng 1% AAPI students when the actual number might be 2%. And when looking at race data for other groups which are much larger it is even easier to draw conclusions about racial representation and trends in DCPS schools. If a school has 82 white students and 315 black students but the data reports 76 white students and 320 black students you can still draw broad conclusions about the racial composition of the school. Also when doing statistical analysis you can minimize the impact of small inaccuracies in the data by aggregating data. So for instance if you look at racial data across a set of schools or over a number of years you can draw more conclusions because the aggregation of data will offer information that you cannot get from just looking at a single data collection at one point in time. That's why the Edscape data is useful. You don't need to just look at a single report of a school's racial composition in 2023-2024 and try to draw conclusions. They will show you how the data tracks over 5+ years and also allow you to compare it against other schools over the same time period or to contrast with all of DCPS or all charters or all DC publics. To argue that the data is useless because you may have small inaccuracies in data collection that change population percentage by 1-2 percentage points is to throw the baby out with the bath water.",63

Meanwhile, Hispanic enrollment is up 37% for high school! So, black and white enrollment are rising together (maybe with similar gradual improving perceptions) while Hispanic enrollment has skyrocketed.  I wonder what the factors are.
		 Existence of DCI. Existence of MacArthur. Those are both examples of additional high-quality seats. Other new schools such as Girls Global, WLA, and Digital Pioneers.  There's a really big increase at Coolidge and I'm not sure why. Both in-boundary and OOB increased, and all grades levels.

		 It looks like, with Coolidge, the hispanic and black enrollment have gone up a lot.  I know that Wells has an increasing population of white students.  I wonder if that will translate to a similarly growing white population soon.
		 This data shows Wells as 1% white. And even if it were growing significantly I doubt it would flow through to high school. Stuart-Hobson is 17% white and that hasn't made a difference for Eastern. 
		 Don’t look now but this data actually shows increasing white enrollment at Eastern.
		 Oke doke. Up from 6 kids to 21 kids over 5 years. 1% to 2%. Amazing, wow.
		 And this is against data showing overall enrollment growth so the increase is even less statistically significant. 
		 The overall percentage increase may be negligible, but when there has historically been almost no buy-in from in-bounds white families, having a more than three-fold increase is notable. Those kids often bring siblings behind them and can be a resource for other families considering Eastern.",65

		 ... As was mentioned earlier in this thread, enrollment could also be increasing because of the different and potentially appealing programs that are being offered at the schools. I know several are offering early college programs or joint enrollment options. Eastern has IB for the older grades and they just rolled out an application cohort called EPIC for 9th and 10th. I know the numbers of students enrolling in those areas programs has been increasing. It's hard to get an accurate sense of who is taking advantage of these programs because sometimes they only count students who are doing the full IB or full other types of programs. At Eastern for example I know some kids who are enrolled in some of the IB courses but also some of the health/science courses, so they probably don't count fully in either one. Anyway, there's a lot more beneath the surface than just counting numbers of white students...",74

		 Couple general thoughts here for people to think about. As has been said in many threads here, Data and school quality is a lot more nuanced than the black and white picture people like to paint here. Most every high school in DC has rigorous options for the students who enroll in them (dual enrollment, IB, internships during high school etc). However, not all kids enroll in these programs and there are a lot of kids coming out of DC public schools less prepared than they need to be. But even that doesn't always directly reflect teaching quality, as also has been discussed on this thread there's a huge problem with truancy, so a huge factor in the students not performing well is not being in school enough over the courses of several years. All that to say, there are some really bright and accomplished students who graduate from high schools across the city, and it isn't fair to make generalized assumptions that just because they went to a high school in DC they are woefully unprepared.",82

DCPS is unquestionably strongest at the ECE and elementary level where there are many good in-boundary options throughout the city including Title 1 programs as well as a host of city-wide and charter schools that offer true choice to parents regardless of where they live and the resources at their disposal. But middle school gets dodgier and by high school it is a truly tricky needle to thread to ensure a kid is accessing adequate (not stellar but merely adequate) programming.",85

But even that doesn't always directly reflect teaching quality, as also has been discussed on this thread there's a huge problem with truancy, so a huge factor in the students not performing well is not being in school enough over the courses of several years. All that to say, there are some really bright and accomplished students who graduate from high schools across the city, and it isn't fair to make generalized assumptions that just because they went to a high school in DC they are woefully unprepared.
		 Look I don't disagree that the picture is nuance but the PP isn't talking in generalities they are talking about specific schools. While of course there are bright and accomplished students graduating from high schools across the city if you look at certain non-application DCPS schools it should give you pause as to whether they will prepare your kid for college (assuming that is the goal -- an easy assumption on this board). Our by-right HS is Dunbar and our feeder school is Eastern. I would love to stay open minded at both but I have to also be realistic. Dunbar has a 73% graduation rate and 38% of graduates pursue a college or vocational degree within 6 months of graduation (that number rises to 43% for 12 months). Less than 1% of students take an AP math class at any time during their time there and the math PARCC/CAPE scores for the school for math show that less than 10 students obtained a 4 or a 5 on the math section (for English it's just over 20% total scoring a 4 or 5). In 2023 Dunbar reported a truancy rate of 82%. I want you to really sit with these numbers and ask yourself what the likelihood is of a student attending this school and being ready for college. Like even assuming a bright kid who works hard and gets great support at home and takes the hardest classes available to him (raising a question of WHO he is taking these challenging courses with) I want to ask you if this is an environment that you think would prepare a student for the rigor of college. Any college. Don't gaslight people.",89

		 There are tons of trade programs in DCPS, they call them CTE (Career and Technical Education). You can see them here sorted by school. The kids that I have met who are enrolled in these programs are getting to do some amazing things and I know I wasn't exposed to in high school. Whether they use that to get a job right after high school or apply it to a major or minor field of interest in college, it is great to have the options .https://dcpscte.org/",92

DCPS is unquestionably strongest at the ECE and elementary level where there are many good in-boundary options throughout the city including Title 1 programs as well as a host of city-wide and charter schools that offer true choice to parents regardless of where they live and the resources at their disposal. But middle school gets dodgier and by high school it is a truly tricky needle to thread to ensure a kid is accessing adequate (not stellar but merely adequate) programming.
		 Respectfully disagree. (Note i did it without hyperbolic use of ""insane"" and similar overwrought reactions). First, ""ECE"" =/ elementary education. It is PK-K. Even if we agree that ECE is generally good, that doesn't mean those ES are good through K. You are also ignoring the mobility of HS kids vs those of ES. Parents are generally limited by geography for ES kids. They need to be dropped off and picked up so all ES across the city are not options for all parents. HS kids can get themselves to and from school on public transit or walk longer distances. They self release. Finally, application HS are true choice; you have the option to apply to any of them. Choice doesn't mean you get what you want, it means you have an equal chance at getting what you want, all other things being equal.  You join the pantheon of pedantic posts looking to pick a fight about something ancillary to the broader discussion.

		 This is the tragedy and irony of the liberal class in DC (of which I am a member) and DCUM. We complain about places like BASIS ""driving kids out"" and being unrelenting and inflexible in their approach but in the next breath we clutch our pearls about the inflated graduation rates and kids wholly unprepared for college or life. We have no answers but darn if we don't love to participate in the discussion anyway.",94

		 Because I don't think raw PARCC scores tell you that much, especially with the efforts BASIS makes to manipulate their scores. I try to bring a lot more nuance to the data. And because DCI is far better on language (obviously), arts, activities, and sports. And better building. Teacher quality, I dunno, honestly neither school is hitting a home run there. There are plenty of students at DCI to provide a high performing peer group, and while of course I wish everyone could do well academically, I don't think my kids' experience is negatively affected by attending the same school as lower-scoring kids. 
		 Agree with above.  Of course academics are important but there is much more to a kids school experience then just academic and that is why Basis loses kids who do well by the time high school comes around.   I would also argue that DCI does a much better job serving a wider range of kids with a wider range of abilities including high and low performing.  This is especially true at the high school level where they have different tracks.  So yes, their scores are lower but it doesn’t mean that they can’t serve the high performing kids.",110

FWIW, I am in the hard science field for work.  Basis too focused oriented on AP.  Rushes all kids too fast thru AP so superficial advancement at the cost of real depth, analysis, and content. 3.

Basis very limited, not enough students and therefore interest to run robust clubs, sports, extracurriculars. Our kid is high performing and having evaluated both, we knew he would not be happy at Basis.

Good writing and critical thinking skills are more important to develop in high school. Our experience and evaluation is just that ours.  Others may have had a different impression or evaluation.  But my point is that PARCC scores don’t tell the whole story and you should look deeper.  Other factors can also be just as important for your kid. For our kid that was sports and extracurriculars.

		 Interesting to hear! I'm truly glad that DC has a number of high school (and middle school) options. We chose BASIS. Besides the rigorous curriculum (a good fit for our kid), the factor that actually pushed me over the edge was the lack of screens. BASIS is old school, with the handwritten notes and a planner, and I think kids learn much better that way. DCI was not appealing bc of their reliance on Chromebooks.  I will push back lightly on some of these for anyone reading. There are plenty of clubs and sports (the kids can also create their own clubs), and, like a ""mini thesis,"" all of the seniors have to spend a few months entirely devoted to a capstone project and then present their report to the community. It's kind of like a mini gap year (and like a gap year, some kids really knock it out of the park and some kind of squander it).",114

		 That is just dumb. PARCC is a standardized test taken across the district.  It tests basic ELA and math skills. The fact is that most kids at DCI are performing below grade level in both English and math.  That is very concerning. And the PARCC scores track with other data points such as DCI's average SAT score, which is way below BASIS. Maybe there are reasons for it.  For example, kids are poor, teaching is bad, kids spend too much time on foreign language instruction, etc.  But the fact remains that DCI is subpar.",115

Hence, less attrition after 7th grade. 3) There will always be kids who leave for Walls or other high schools for 9th grade.  Seems totally normal to want to try something new.  However, fewer kids have done that over the past 5 years.
		 Ah yes, again the myth that anyone who leaves BASIS ""washed out"". As opposed to doing fine and choosing a different school because BASIS isn't that great, which apparently never happens. 
		 Or because the parents didn't do their research. No one forces anyone to go to BASIS.   You should have opted for your crappy in-bounds school from the beginning.
		 I did not send any kid to BASIS, because I don't think it's that great. But if someone decides to give BASIS a try, decides ""meh"", and opts for something else (perhaps something they couldn't have had for 5th such as DCI or Deal), I don't think that means they or their child aren't smart. It's bizarre how defensive people are about BASIS. Some people just aren't that into it, and that's okay.
		 What school are your kids at?
		 DCI, via the lottery. Does it matter?
		 DP.  Just wondering why you think DCI is good and BASIS is meh. I have an academic kid, so we are looking at BASIS. Here are the PARCC scores for high school for the two schools--not only is BASIS way ahead of DCI but a majority of kids at DCI are below grade level in both English and math. BASIS ELA 92.06 Math 66.12 DCI ELA 41.87 Math 20.74
		 Not PP but we looked at both schools with the curriculum, facility, extracurriculars, and met and talked with leadership.  PARCC scores are just one aspect of so many.  Don’t base your choices just on that and know your kid and their needs. Below is why we think DCI is better: 1. Leadership - super impressed with the high school principal at DCI.  Person of integrity and character who cares about the kids.  Did a very informative and thorough slide presentation about schools curriculum, offerings, extracurriculars, track options and requirements, etc…Talked with him one on one and asked hard questions and answers given were thoughtful and honest.  Head at Basis young, slick talking guy who gave BS answers and who was arrogant and pompous.  Reminds me of a car salesmen.    2. Curriculum - IB diploma the highest track.  Heavy focus on critical analysis and writing so more humanities focus.  Mini-thesis required.  School still offers good STEM courses with amazing lab facilities (bio, chem), amazing robotic facilities/club.  They have a whole allied science track. FWIW, I am in the hard science field for work.  Basis too focused oriented on AP.  Rushes all kids too fast thru AP so superficial advancement at the cost of real depth, analysis, and content. 3.  Facilities - DCI college campus like with building and grounds.  Building bright, spacious, good layout.  Fields.   Basis dark, depressing, very cramped.  Felt more like an office building than a school. 4. Sports and extracurriculars - so many at DCI.  School very encouraging to students in starting new clubs and extracurriculars and big enough and with enough student and interest to do it.  Basis very limited, not enough students and therefore interest to run robust clubs, sports, extracurriculars. Our kid is high performing and having evaluated both, we knew he would not be happy at Basis.  Yes, more high achieving cohort then DCI in terms of numbers but at the cost of other things that we felt was important in balancing the academics.  We crossed out Basis from our list. Lastly, as someone in the hard sciences, IMO plenty of time to specialize in the sciences in college.  Good writing and critical thinking skills are more important to develop in high school. Our experience and evaluation is just that ours.  Others may have had a different impression or evaluation.  But my point is that PARCC scores don’t tell the whole story and you should look deeper.  Other factors can also be just as important for your kid. For our kid that was sports and extracurriculars.  We also like that DCI is a medium size school and not too small from a social aspect for him too.
		 DCI is in the bottom half of the world in terms of IB scores, so that isn't really impressive.
		 You need to understand things in context.  DCI is close or at the mean score worldwide which has ranged between 30-32 the past few years.  2023 it was 30 total points.  So they are not at the bottom.  They are more towards the middle. The overwhelming majority of schools that do IB worldwide either are private, magnets, or self selects their students.  DCI doesn’t so from this context, it is impressive what they are achieving.  Some students have scored higher and have gotten into Ivy’s. WIS average might be 1 or 2 points higher but you need to fork out close to 52K a year to go there.",118

		 PP, I can tell your kid is younger because only parents of younger kids make that kind of sweeping comparison of PARCC. Try to get a more detailed understanding of what PARCC does and doesn't test at the high school level. It really doesn't tell us much at all about how high performing high school students are doing. A lot of them aren't even in a course that's tested at all.
		 That is just dumb. PARCC is a standardized test taken across the district.  It tests basic ELA and math skills. The fact is that most kids at DCI are performing below grade level in both English and math.  That is very concerning. And the PARCC scores track with other data points such as DCI's average SAT score, which is way below BASIS. Maybe there are reasons for it.  For example, kids are poor, teaching is bad, kids spend too much time on foreign language instruction, etc.  But the fact remains that DCI is subpar.
		 Again, you're showing your cluelessness. The PARCC (now CAPE) is taken across the district, and yes tests basic skills, and as a result, it doesn't tell you very much about high schools at all. Because the PARCC only tests, for example, Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry, it doesn't tell you anything at all about student performance in higher math classes. Same for ELA. So a lot of the juniors and seniors don't take any PARCC at all. You also need to also understand that BASIS has different rules about which students take which PARCC tests, based on BASIS' goal of having ""the best"" scores. You can't just compare the overall scores because the two schools approach it so differently.  Yes, DCI has a far higher at-risk percentage-- but isn't BASIS moving in that direction? You might not like BASIS as much as you think, if that bothers you. And DCI has different demographics in many ways but it also has far more students whose first language is not English.  If you're the kind of person who thinks the best rolled-up PARCC scores = the best school, I really can't help you. Go for it, enjoy BASIS, to each their own. Personally, I think that the PARCC doesn't measure a lot of things that matter about the school, and I want my kids to have a well-rounded experience with everything that a bigger and more comprehensive school can offer. DCI has an ample group of academic high performers and it just doesn't really bother me that they don't filter for academics as aggressively as BASIS. Enjoy your sad dark office building!",119

		 DCI has almost 4 times more at risk kids than Basis and also more sped.  They also don’t “self select” like Basis in failing kids and not passing them thus forcing families to leave.  They don’t have adequate support for these kids. So of course no surprises that their PARCC scores are higher.  It’s a given.",120
"For BASIS/DCI, different kids would benefit from one or the other more, but unfortunately that's now how the lottery/feeders work.  If you are interested in DCI, at this point you need to be at a feeder school, generally that's decided in early elementary.

		 Honestly this bothers me zero amount. It’s todally fine with me to have a school premised on being able to meet academic standards and behavioral standards. If BASIS made zero effort to get kids up to speed for the comprehensive exams then maybe I’d think that was wrong; but from what I understand they spend a lot of time in 5th and 6th getting kids ready.",125

		 You are dead wrong. The Basis curriculum is very rigorous and challenging, and the teaching is generally high-quality (certainly better than other DC publics).  Some people drop out.  ""The lowest performers"" are not ""removed.""  No one is kicked out for being a bad student.  But no one is promoted to the next grade just for social reasons.  And no one is replaced, regardless of why they leave.  Someone goes to a Big Three private or Walls?  Not replaced.  Someone goes to their in-bounds?  Not replaced.  Someone moves overseas or to another state with their family?  Not replaced.  Hence, the numbers go down. No one is saying other DC middle schools are bad.  But the fact is that Basis is more academically challenging than those schools and has the test scores to prove it.",142

		 I should have specified it’s basically the only middle school EOTP that challenges even the high achieving kids.  Sure Latin is great too but not so much for math and science.  Such a disingenuous comment to suggest people can choose to send their Deal and Hardy.  People can choose to send their kid their if they have the money to move in bounds.  Easy for folks in upper northwest to bash schools like BASIS and act like everyone has an in bounds like Deal or Hardy to choose.  Go back to your bubble.",144

Luckily I started spending time in the building and talking to current families.

Some kids will find it stressful, some kids will thrive in that environment.  I really can't believe I almost let the ""I've HEARD"" people keep me from this opportunity -- if you live EOTP and you have a particular kind of kid, you have to consider it. 
		 People have heard first hand from students or families with kids there so…. and these students are not struggling at the school.  It’s really idiotic that Basis boosters try to paint the picture that only the struggling kids leave.

Even despite that, it is the best middle option for advanced kids EOTP, and it's not even close. The reason I'm irritated is because I almost let this stupid forum dissuade me from sending my kid (who is a 98th percentile both sections kid -- a good fit, in other words) there. Luckily I started spending time in the building and talking to current families. Imagine my surprise to find out that it's possible to be very happy there, and that the curriculum goes way beyond DCPS for middle, that the high school does offer classes like AP psych or music theory -- it's broad, in other words. He has peers, he's excited to learn, and it's a good fit.  I've also talked to people who left and hated it, and it's usually bc their kids found it stressful. Some kids will find it stressful, some kids will thrive in that environment.  I really can't believe I almost let the ""I've HEARD"" people keep me from this opportunity -- if you live EOTP and you have a particular kind of kid, you have to consider it. 
		 Good post.  A lot of Basis haters here with a chip on their shoulders.  If you are making a decision based on what you read here you are making a big mistake.
		 Not a Basis hater at all.  But what I have noticed is that most of the Basis crowd is so defensive and cannot acknowledge certain realities and truths that are obvious.  That is why there are so many responses and counter to Basis posters. Exhibit X is the discussion on here about their PARCC scores and they are high because they self select and take out the bottom.  The equivalent comparison of Basis is with other schools that self select like Walls, Banneker, etc… not DCI.  Why can’t Basis people on here just acknowledge the obvious truth??   The other trend is that on many discussions about specific schools EOTP, Basis families jump in and make it all about Basis and overtake the thread.   It’s just seems odd why so many Basis families are so defensive, insecure, and need to make so many posts about them.   I don’t see this happening on a regular basis with any other school EOTP on here.
		 You seem confused. Basis is 100% lottery. Walls and Banneker select their students.

"How many kids are allowed to enroll in 7th grade or beyond at Basis without ever passing comps? That’s right, zero.  Basis operates a test-in 7-12 school with a two-year in-house prep program that admits by lottery.  Which is why the Basis HS proficiency rates look a lot like the Walls and Banneker proficiency rates: all three are selective high schools. You all brag about comps and “no social promotion.” Comps and your test-in 7-12 school are two sides of the same coin. One produces the other, necessarily and by design. Claiming one while denying the other is nonsense. And the PP is right. A lot of the heat on BASIS threads is due to widespread frustration with your unrelenting intellectual dishonesty about this.",161

		 Thank you PP for this very well stated explanation! I never thought of it that way but BASIS 7-12 is test-in, and the test is the 6th grade comps.",162
